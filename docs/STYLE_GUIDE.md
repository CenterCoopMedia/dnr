# Daily News Roundup - story selection guide

This document defines the criteria for selecting and categorizing stories in each section of the Daily News Roundup newsletter.

---

## General principles

### What makes a story newsletter-worthy

1. **New Jersey focus required** - Story must be directly about New Jersey, not just mentioning NJ in passing
2. **Timeliness** - Published within the time window (36 hours for Tue-Thu, weekend coverage for Monday)
3. **News value** - Actual news reporting, not opinion pieces, press releases, or promotional content
4. **Source attribution** - Must have a credible NJ news source

### What to always exclude

- Generic broadcast announcements (e.g., "WHYY Newscast for Tuesday, 11:00 a.m.")
- National/wire stories without specific NJ focus
- NYC-only news (Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, etc.)
- Stories from other states (PA, CT, DE) unless NJ is the primary focus
- Press releases disguised as news
- Sponsored content or advertorials
- Opinion/editorial pieces (unless major and newsworthy)

2. **Statewide government impact** - Major policy decisions, budget news, legislative action affecting all of NJ
3. **Major investigations/watchdog reporting** - Accountability journalism with significant findings
4. **Significant court rulings** - State Supreme Court decisions, federal court rulings affecting NJ
5. **Major infrastructure announcements** - Gateway Tunnel, NJ Transit system-wide changes, airport expansions

### Examples from history

**GOOD Top Stories:**

- "Bill to strip New Jersey comptroller's powers advances" (6+ outlets, government accountability)
- "NJ declares state of emergency after SNAP suspension" (statewide crisis, multi-outlet)
- "Watchdog report: Norcross-founded firm violated conflict laws" (major investigation, 4 outlets)
- "Gov. Murphy signs $58.8B NJ budget with tax hikes" (7 outlets, statewide budget impact)

**BAD Top Stories (should be in other sections or skipped):**
- "Five-alarm blaze at Pepsi facility" → Local news, not policy
- "Shocking killing of Cranford teens" → Crime story, belongs nowhere or in politics if policy-related
- "New ramen shop opens" → Lastly section

## Quality over quantity

Each section should have approximately 5-20 stories maximum. Prioritize:

1. Stories with multiple outlet coverage
2. Stories with clear NJ impact
3. Stories from tier-1 NJ news sources
4. Breaking/timely news over evergreen content

It's better to have fewer, more relevant stories than to pad sections with marginal content.
