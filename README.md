# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install Playwright browsers (for paywalled sites)
playwright install chromium
```

### Configuration

Create a `.env` file with your API credentials:

```env
# Anthropic (required)
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here

# Airtable (required)
AIRTABLE_PAT=your_personal_access_token
AIRTABLE_BASE_ID=your_base_id
AIRTABLE_TABLE_ID=your_table_id

# Mailchimp (required)
MAILCHIMP_API_KEY=your_api_key
MAILCHIMP_SERVER_PREFIX=us1  # or your server prefix
MAILCHIMP_LIST_ID=your_audience_id

# Google Gemini (optional, for URL enrichment)
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

## Usage

### Quick start (Windows)

```bash
# Standard workflow (RSS + Airtable)
DNR_Standard.bat

# Full workflow (includes Playwright for paywalled sites)
DNR_Full.bat
```

### Command line

```bash
# Interactive workflow
python src/workflow.py

# With Playwright sources
python src/workflow.py --playwright

# With URL enrichment
python src/workflow.py --enrich

# Custom time range (hours back)
python src/workflow.py --hours 48

# Direct pipeline (no interactive prompts)
python src/main.py --preview
python src/main.py --dry-run
```

## Workflow

The interactive workflow has 7 steps:

1. **Fetch stories** - Collects from RSS feeds, Airtable, and optionally Playwright
2. **Enrich stories** (optional) - Uses Gemini API to extract context from URLs
3. **Classify stories** - Claude Haiku assigns each story to a section
4. **Review Airtable submissions** - Approve source/section for user submissions
5. **Generate HTML preview** - Creates preview file in `drafts/`
6. **Review and refine** - Natural language feedback loop
7. **Create Mailchimp draft** - Ready for final review and send

### Natural language feedback

During step 6, you can refine the newsletter using plain English:

```
Feedback: Move the NJ Transit story to politics
    ✓ Moved 'nj transit...' from top_stories to politics

Feedback: Remove the carjacking story from top stories
    ✓ Removed 'carjacking...' from top_stories

Feedback: done
```

## Content filtering

The system automatically filters inappropriate content from top stories:

**Blocked from top_stories:**
- Crime stories (carjacking, murder, robbery, shooting)
- Car crashes and accidents
- High school sports scores and schedules
- Gift guides and shopping deals
- Lottery and Powerball results
- Restaurant reviews and food rankings
- Expensive house sale stories

**Filtered entirely:**
- Generic broadcast announcements ("WHYY Newscast for Tuesday...")
- Non-NJ content (NYC-only, national news without NJ angle)

See `docs/STYLE_GUIDE.md` for complete story selection criteria.
